# Climate Change, Conflict, and Economic Adaptation: Perspectives on Migration and Sustainable Development

## Course Overview
This course, offered at the University of Basel, provides students with comprehensive insights into the intersection of climate change, conflict, and economic adaptation, with a focus on migration and sustainable development.

## Instructor
**Elisa D’Amico**  
University of Basel

## Course Objectives
- Understand the impact of climate change on global conflict dynamics.
- Analyze the role of economic adaptation in mitigating these impacts.
- Explore migration as a response to climate-induced changes and conflicts.
- Develop skills in data analysis and interpretation within the context of sustainable development.

## Resources Provided
As part of the course, students were provided with:
- **Datasets**: Relevant and comprehensive data to support their analyses.
- **Sample Code**: Example scripts to help students run their analyses and interpret the results independently.


# Green Infrastructure Projects in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): Impact on Displacement and Resource Conflict

## Overview
This repository contains data and code developed from a student's research question: *Does the emergence of Green Infrastructure Projects in the DRC increase displacement and resource conflict?* This project has evolved into a credited learning contract and co-authorship, contributing to a deeper understanding of the socio-environmental dynamics in the DRC.

## Research Context
The Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) is rich in natural resources, including minerals like coltan, copper, diamonds, tin, gold, and cobalt. These resources are often extracted through mining activities that can lead to displacement and resource conflicts. The emergence of Green Infrastructure Projects, aimed at promoting sustainable development and environmental conservation, may influence these dynamics. However, the relationship between such projects and displacement or resource conflict in the DRC remains underexplored.

## Repository Contents
- **Data**: Comprehensive datasets on Green Infrastructure Projects, displacement records, and resource conflict incidents in the DRC.
- **Code**: Sample code for data analysis, including statistical models and visualizations to assess the impact of Green Infrastructure Projects on displacement and resource conflict.

## Methodology
The analysis employs a difference-in-differences framework to evaluate the temporal and spatial effects of Green Infrastructure Projects on displacement and resource conflict. This approach allows for the isolation of the impact of these projects by comparing regions with and without such initiatives over time.

## Acknowledgments
This research was conducted as part of a credited learning contract and co-authorship, with guidance and support from Elisa D'Amico at the University of St Andrews.
